1 - Find magic
    - Find the sneaky file in all 20000 of the files...
        - find . -name '*sneaky*'
    - Copy it to all the other directories
        - find command here...
2 - Some cool stuff with awk and sed
    - Alice in Wonderland?

        - venture through alice in wonderland
            - find how many times allice is referenced in the file...
                - grep -oi 'alice' 11.txt
            - sed - turn allice in wonderland into fanny in wonderland
            - make multiple versions of our friends in wonderland

        - crime types are in column 6 (one based)
        

4 - Man's best friend

Learning for the peoples:
     - Moving around on a CLI
        - ls
        - cd
        - whoami O.o

    - Making new things and moving stuff around:
        - mkdir, touch
        - mv, cp

    - Finding things
        - grep
            - I've got 3000 files of data, and want to find that one dataset... But I can't remember where I put it...
        - find
            - Boy, I wish I could filter out all these files, and just find the ones that are under 512KB... Then I want to move them off somewhere else
            - My boss is missing a file on the server, and wants me to hunt it down. I know kind of what it's called, but have no idea where it went.

    - For loops! Do things... for all the files!
        - Given 500 files, I want to execute a script for each one. This will take forever to run each one individually... 

    - Piping stuff and directing output
        - cat | wc -l # I really want to know how many lines are in this file, but I don't feel like opening it up
        - I got some output, but I'd like to sort it and get only the unique things... Man that would take a while to write a program for...
            - cat myFile.txt | sort | uniq # That was easy...
